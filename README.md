# AniCards
Gacha-ifies your watched anime via Anilist. Pull for characters from watched shows, adding them to your collection. Main characters are rare, while side characters are more common. Pulls are given by episodes watched.

Warning: in the current release, images are grabbed from Anilist in batches when an anime is selected. With a lot of characters and shows, this can use a lot of download data and storage.
